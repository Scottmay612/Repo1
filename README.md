# Overview

I am setting up a repository so that I know how to do it again for future projects. I will be doing many different projects to further my learning in different programming languages.

This is a Hello World program that acts as a introduction to using repositories for my projects. To add some code, I write hello world and I made a function that calculates the area of a circle.
